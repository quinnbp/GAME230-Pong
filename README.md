# Space Pong

## Description

Space Pong is a C++ clone of the original game Pong, built to learn more about C++ and approach game physics.
This version features original music, a 2-player mode, and multiball powerups.

## Execution

Everything needed for execution of the game is in PongFinal.zip. 
Space pong utilizes SFML and some custom textures, so the executable will not run without the additional files in its current state.
